# pyngine
a python based game engine 


To all who are not me. This is in fact a very rudimentary and unfinished product. It is in no means intended to actually use in any capacity. It is designed to go mainly along with my multiplayer engine which as of current is private and will remain so as I am testing because I'm too lazy to set up any security measures until its at least somewhat usable.
